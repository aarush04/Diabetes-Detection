# Diabetic Patient Detection

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning models. The notebook explores data preprocessing techniques, implements various machine learning algorithms, and fine-tunes the Random Forest Classifier to achieve optimal accuracy.

## Key Highlights
- **Objective**: Create a reliable prediction model for detecting diabetes.
- **Outcome**: Achieved 81% accuracy using a fine-tuned Random Forest Classifier.
- **Dataset**: A publicly available diabetes dataset (details in the notebook).

## Features
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values by imputing with mean values for specific features.
- Performed correlation analysis and visualization using heatmaps.
- Applied scaling techniques to standardize data for model input.
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

### Model Implementation
- Tested multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.
- Used hyper-parameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest Classifier.

### Evaluation
